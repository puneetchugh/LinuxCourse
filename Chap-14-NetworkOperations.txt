#Introduction to Networking

A network is a group of computers and computing devices connected together through communication channels such as cables or wireless media. the connected computers may be located in the same geographical area or spread across the world

#IP addresses
Devices attached to have a network must have at least one unique network address identifider know as IP address. 

#IPv4 address has 32 bit addresses divided into 4 octets(bytes)
There are only 4.3 billion unique addresses available

#IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses that was used to overcome the limitations of IPv4 addresses
There can be 3.4x 10 power 32 unique addresses

#IPv4 addresses
IPv4 addresses are divided into Network Id (NetID) and Host ID.
They are represented as octets.

Example:
IP address →            172  .          16  .          31  .         46
Bit format →         10101100.       00010000.      00011111.     00101110

There are 3 classes A,B,C,D,E 

Class A,B,C actually classified into two parts : NetId and HostId
Class D is used for special multicast purpose 
Class E is reserved for future use

Class A
NetId - 8 bits - Starts with 0xxxxxxx - 126 (128-2) addresses - the addresses 00000000 and 01111111 are reserved
HostId - 24 bits - 16 million hosts
All 1's in NetId are part of the loop back addresses 
Each NetId has 16 million hosts
Range : 1.x.x.x -> 1.0.0.1 - 1.255.255.254
	2.x.x.x -> 2.0.0.1 - 2.255.255.254
	   .          .             .
           .          .             .
           .          .             . 
	126.x.x.x->126.0.0.1 - 126.255.255.254
	127.x.x.x-> loopback or localhost addresses : 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address

Class B
NetId - 16 bits - Starts with 10 - There are overall 2power14 netids
HostId - 16 bits - 65,536 host ids
All 1's in NetId are part of loopback addressses
Each NetId has 65,536 addresses
Range : 128.0.x.x -> 128.0.0.1 - 128.0.255.254 (128.0.0.0 and 128.255.255.255 are broadcast/multicast addresses)
	129.0.x.x -> 129.0.0.1 - 129.0.255.254
	     .            .
             .            .
	191.255.x.x -> 191.255.255.254

Class C    
NetId - 24 bits - Starts with 110
HostId - 8 bits - 256 addresses
Each NetId has 256 addresses
Range : 192.0.0.x -> 192.0.0.1 - 192.0.0.254
	193.0.0.x -> 193.0.0.1 - 193.0.0.254
	223.0.0.x -> 223.0.0.1 - 223.0.0.254

Class D - Multicast address
NetId - Starts with 1110
Range: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255

Class E - Reserved
NedId - Starts with 1111
Range : 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255
