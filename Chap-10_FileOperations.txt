#Mount a partition 
#mount /dev/sda5 to /home
mount /dev/sda5 /home

#Unmount /home
unmount /home

#See all mounts 
mount

#Show information about all mounted filesystem
df -Th

#Filesystem could be spread on multiple network nodes
#NFS daemons and other system servers are started using the following command
sudo systemctl start nfs
sudo systemctl restart nfs
sudo systemctl enable nfs

#For the filesystem to be mounted automatically when the system comes up into a multi-user mode
/etc/fstab

#Each user has a home directory under /home
#/root directory on the modern Linux system is no more than the home directory

#You can create groups and then have them under the group under home
#Like /home/faculty/
#Like /home/staff/

# The /bin directory contains executable used to boot the system or in single-user mode and essential commands required by all system users


# /sbin is intended for essential binaries related to system admin, such as fsck and shutdown

#/usr/bin and /bin are actually just symbolically linked
#/user/sbin and /sbin are also symbolically linked

#/proc filesystem contains virtual files (only exists in memory) that permit viewing constantly varying kernel data. These files and directories mimic kernel structures and configurations information
#It doesn't contain the real files, but runtime system info 

#/dev directory contains device nodes, these are pseudo-file used by most hardware and software devices, except for network devices 
#These are files created by udev
#
#    /dev/sda1 (first partition on the first hard disk)
#    /dev/lp1 (second printer)
#    /dev/dvd1 (first DVD drive).

#/var (variable) filesystem contains the content whose size and content changes like 
#/var/log
#/var/lib
#/var/spool
#/var/tmp
#/var/ftp
#/var/www

#/etc directory is the home for the system configuration files
#/etc also contains some script files, but all the configuration files are system wide and only superuser can modify them

#/boot files contains the files required for booting including GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)

#/lib and /lib64 contains files for application programs in /bin and /sbin. 
#These file names start with lib or ld
#most of them are dynamically loaded libraries or shared librairies or shared objects (.so)

#Removable media go under /media , /mnt or modern versions under /run


#/opt -> Optional application software packages
#/sys -> virtual pseudo-filesystem giving info about system & hardware. Can be used to alter system parameters and for debugging purposes
#/usr -> Multi-user applications, utilities and data

#diff is used to compare files and directories
#diff -c strings.xml strings.xml_1
#diff -q strings.xml strings.xml_1 #Be quiet and just tell the two files are different

#diff3 is used to compare 3 files at one time

#diff -Nur originalfile newfile > patchfile

#dd is used for copying and also performing some operations on the file 
# The following two commands are about copying /etc/group file to /tmp/GROUP and converts the text to uppercase conv=ucase
dd if=/etc/group of=/tmp/group
dd if=/tmp/group of=/tmp/GROUP conv=ucase

#rsync is used for copying data. It can be used to synchronize entire directory tree
#rsync avoids unecessary copy and save time as it copies only the parts of files that have actually changed and its fast
#rsync can copy files over network as well using target:path and target is of the form [user@]host
#rsych is very efficient copying one directory tree to another because only the differences are transmitted over the network
